EXPLANATION: 
Yuconz is a consultancy that provides services to small-to-medium sized organisations. 
Yuconz has 4 directors who each run Administration, Sales and Marketing, Services Delivery, and Human Resources.
Managers report to Directors, and Operational Staff report to their Managers.
Human Resources wants an IT system to manage administration of employment documents.

Authentication enables a user to gain access to the system with a particular authorisation level.

Authorisation checks the permission to undertake the requested action.
All authorisation attempts are logged on the authorisation server regardless of success or failure.
A user must log out of their current session and re-authenticate to change their authentication role.

Personal Details are created and managed by HR and then may be amended by the person it belongs to.
A record may be read by whom it is related to as well as members of HR but no one else.

When an employee is reviewed, the employee prepares the review document and this is made available to the reviewers.
The document is discussed and amended in the review meeting by all participants.
The document is signed off and becomes read only once signed by all 3 participants.
The authentication and authorisation process allows someone to authenticate as the reviewer but cannot read other documents unrelated to them.

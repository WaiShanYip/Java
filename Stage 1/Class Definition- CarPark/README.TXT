AUTHOR: Wai Shan (Karen) Yip
EXPLANATION: 
This assignment focuses on defining a class and applying the fundamentals of Java. 
The class called CarPark holds some basic details about the state of a single car park. 

There are get methods which return the location, capacity and occupancy of the car park. 
If the occupancy level is greater than or equal to the capacity then an error message explains the car park is full,
otherwise the car can park and the occupancy level increases by 1.
If the occupancy level is greater than 0, the car can leave the car park and the occupancy level is decreased by 1.
The maximum capacity of the car park can be changed.
The location of the car park as well as the occupancy status can be printed.
